-----------------------------

Known Bugs:

1. If you choose not to continue after a tie with the AI, the scoreboard does not show the correct score.
2. Sometimes need to press 'n' twice to properly make the program stop.
3. Player 'O' sometimes starts, this was due to a hotfix solving a much bigger bug. This was the lesser of two evils.
4. When playing against the AI, the game sometimes halts randomly on the last turn, requiring a Ctrl-C to exit.
